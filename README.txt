This is a machine learning project using FIFA 2022 data and k-means algorithm to group goalkeepers into different clusters. 
The purpose of the webapp is for a scout to be able to select the parameters of a goalkeeper they are looking for and get a results (cluster) back that the scout could use to help in their search to recruit a goalkeeper. 

The machine learning model is done using PyCaret, Seaborn, etc. and the code can be viewed in the Colab notebook.
The webapp front end uses React.JS, which can be viewed in the src folder, and the backend uses Flask, which can be viewed in the api folder.
